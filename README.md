# EMTdubLZ

pronounced: E M T (double) Z

This is one of the BEST and cheapest ways to get a metal frame and stiffen up your Anet A8 (or other similar printer).

2x10' of 3/4" EMT tubing ( you'll have a good length left over for other fun projects !)- $16
75x #10x3/4 metal self-tapping screws - $7
3/4 of a spool of your preferred filament - $18

2 Z axis supports that are staggered front to back and left to right providing a more rigid frame. Does take quit a bit of measuring to get everything square but, when done correctly this is a super stiff frame.

Derived from the original EMT8: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2818084

Printed parts:

Two of each:
frame-corner-v2-fl_rr.stl 
frame-corner-v2-fr_lr.stl 
everything else should need only one.

Pipe cuts are as follows:

X: 3x 313mm, 1x 398.75mm pipe cutting for optional double top brace, no need to print: "Right_top_rework.stl" or "Left_top_rework.stl"

Y: 2x 364mm
