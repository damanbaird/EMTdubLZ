# EMTdubLZ

pronounced: E M T (double) Z


This started out in life as one of the BEST and cheapest ways to get a metal framed Anet A8 3D printer. EMTdubLZ has turned into a complete DIY custom printer frame with the avaialbility to custimize as you see fit. Most if not all Anet A8 files on carriages and or the bed from around the net should be usable.

2x10' of 3/4" EMT tubing ( you'll have a good length left over for other fun projects !)- $16
75x #10x3/4 metal self-tapping screws - $11 (https://amzn.to/3cyaun0)
3/4 of a spool of your preferred filament - $18

2 Z axis supports that are staggered front to back and left to right providing a more rigid frame. Does take quit a bit of measuring to get everything square but, when done correctly this is a super stiff frame.
